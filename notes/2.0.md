# Changes for 2.*

## 2.0.6

  * Executable binaries can be create via `make-exec` sbt action
    * Configure the required runtime jars by overriding the `requiredRuntime` method
    * Look at [scetris] for how to use it with a `ParentProject` 

## 2.0.5

  * Openjdk on Mac renders an `unknown` os... adding `Darwin` support.
  * Fixed issue #4... Removed loading anything defined in the user's `JAVA_LIBRARY_PATH`
as I felt this caused more strange issues.
  * `JMonkey` trait became a lot more pimp:
    * Added `jmonkey-cache` which installs jars in ivy cache
    * Added `jmonkey-local` which peeks into your cache, and tells you what you got.
    * Added `jmonkey-clean-cache` which purges all the jmonkeys
    * Update `jmonkey-update` to look at ivy cache first (saves about 3 minutes on first time update)

## 2.0.4

  * Tightened logic for the satellite projects
  * Organized code

## 2.0.3

  * Added custom tasks for extracting LWJGL linked libs and a task for cleaning them (scan)
    * `copy-lwjgl` depends on `copy-resources`, so it's run before compile and run
    * `clean-lwjgl` destroys the linked libs extracted from the lwjgl.jar
  * Added [jMonkey] integration

## 2.0.2

  * Added newest version of lwjgl (scan)
  * Added extraction filters so that it pulls only os libs (scan)
  * Adding future proof support for slick

## 2.0.1 

  * Added all the necessary Slick dependencies
  * Discovered LWJGL [maven repo]
