# Changes for 2.*

## 3/21/2011

  * Added custom tasks for extracting LWJGL linked libs and a task for cleaning them (scan)
    * `copy-lwjgl` depends on `copy-resources`, so it's run before compile and run
    * `clean-lwjgl` destroys the linked libs extracted from the lwjgl.jar
  * Added [jMonkey] integration

## 3/17/2011

  * Added newest version of lwjgl (scan)
  * Added extraction filters so that it pulls only os libs (scan)
  * Adding future proof support for slick

## 3/16/2011

  * Added all the necessary Slick dependencies
  * Discovered LWJGL [maven repo]
